        <h1>Ben's Best Horror Movies!</h1>

        <h2>These are the best three horror movies of all time, objectively speaking.</h2>
        <hr />

            <h3>Scream</h3>

                <p> A slasher movie that manages to deliver the best aspects of the genre, while 
                    simultaneously providing meta commentary on classic horror tropes. Wes Craven created an absolute classic with this one. </p>

            <h3>Hereditary</h3>

                <p>A movie that reinvented horror for the modern movie landscape, pushing elevated horror into 
                    mainstream discussions film discussions. </p>

            <h3>Saw</h3>

             <p>A genre-bending pyschological thriller that spawned an entire subgenre. This is a movie with so much more to
                offer than it's reputation as a bloody, substanceless piece of torture porn. </p>
